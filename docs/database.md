## Database creation

Once the conda environment has been installed, we need to build and format the database to tell  [pyannote-audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) where and how to access the files.
A step-by-step guide is provided in this [jupyter notebook](../database.ipynb). 

We performed all of our experiments on the [DIHARD](https://coml.lscp.ens.fr/dihard/index.html) dataset, but if you want to use your own dataset, you might want to have a look at [this extensive documentation](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-database) describing how everything works.
